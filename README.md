Formula 1 racing is the pinnacle of motor sport. Each race is extremely competitive and each win is dependent on a multitude of factors.

In this project we have taken collected some of the most relevant available factors for each race between 1950 to 2019 and done an analytical deep dive into F1 racing.

We collected and analysed this data and created clean, concise visualizations so as to create an understandable representation of our analysis.
We then used our understanding to create a large variety of models to predict the race winners for the future seasons.

This project taught me how to analyse large amounts of intricate data and how to represent complex ideas in a simple and understandable way
